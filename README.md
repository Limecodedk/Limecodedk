### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Emil from Aarhus. I am a front-end developer with several years of experience in web development. I love translating designs and user experiences into effective and intuitive user interfaces. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React. I also have experience with NextJs. Additionally, I work with Wordpress. I have always been committed to learning more about the latest technology and development trends.
